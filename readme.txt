Adds new fields and requires new users to register additional fields (such as first name and last name) or any new field you wish to add.

Note: WordPress 3.2 or higher is required due to new error handling procedures.

== Description ==

When new users register, this plugin forces new users to register additional fields of your choosing or lets you add your own custom fields. Default available fields are:

*	First Name
*	Last Name
*	Nickname
*	Website
*	AIM screen name
*	Yahoo IM screen name
*	Jabber/Google Talk user name
*	Password

WordPress User Registration Aide Force & Add New User Fields on Registration Form, as the title implies, allows you to require more fields when a new user registers. This not only can help to stop spammers, but it can also increase your user management capabilities and services for your user base. All the new fields that you add also are added to existing users profiles, but the users will have to fill them out of course, but any new users will be required to fill out these fields if they are included in the registration process.

Another important option is that you can also add new fields to the users profile page but not require them for registration, so you can increase you user management capabilities. This is an exciting new feature for Web-masters that wish to increase contact options, communications, and information obtained from your user base.

Add Additional Fields to User Registration Form Option:

This section includes a drop down box with all the existing fields in the WordPress profile, and all the additional new fields that you add, if any. None of them will show up on the registration form until you click the field you want to add to the registration form with your mouse. You can select multiple fields here by holding down the control button (CTRL) while clicking on the fields of your choice to add to the registration form.

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Is there a shortcode?  =

No, there currently is no shortcode as it uses the current registration/profile actions and filters for WordPress so it shows up without the need for a shortcode.

= Where are the new fields? =

First, you need to make sure you are allowing new users to register for your site which is found on the general settings tab on the admin dashboard under membership, make sure you have the Anyone can register checkbox checked.

Then, if you don't know where it is the registration form is on the login form, as there should be a register link at the bottom of the login form page if you are allowing anyone to sign up. Click on the register link to see the registration form and your new extra fields.
